# Hytale Server JAR

This folder should contain the Hytale server JAR file for compilation.

## How to get it

1. **From your Hytale server installation:**
   - Copy `hytale-server.jar` from your server folder

2. **From Hytale Developer Portal:**
   - Visit https://hytale.com/developers
   - Download the server API JAR

## Expected file

```
libs/
└── hytale-server.jar
```

## Note

This file is **compile-only** - it's not bundled with the plugin.
The server provides these classes at runtime.
